      <p>
        This one might also be a banger, but I've yet to try it. We're 
        putting this one on here for the boys, they deserve it.
        We have pounds on pound of ground beef in the fridge, so lets
        hit that up this week.

        For real though, hit this up and get back to me.

      <h3>
        Steps
      </h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients</li>
        <li>
          Cook ground beef, onion, red bell pepper, and garlic in an
          extra-large tall-sided skillet over medium heat until beef is
          no longer pink and vegetables are tender, stirring occasionally
          to break up large chunks of ground beef, about 8 minutes; drain
          fat.
        </li>
        <li>
          Stir in rice, salt, and cumin. Cook and stir for 1 minute.
        </li>
        <li>Stir in tomato paste.</li>
        <li>
          Mix in undrained diced tomatoes, broth, diced chiles, and
          Worcestershire sauce. Bring to boiling. Reduce heat, cover, 
          and simmer until liquid is reduced and rice is tender, 
          about 20 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
          Remove skillet from heat. Sprinkle with cheese. Cover and let
          stand until cheese melts, about 5 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>Garnish with green onion.</li>
      </ol>
