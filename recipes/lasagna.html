    <p>
    This is some goofy lasagna recipe I pulled off of Allrecipes.
    I'll probably never try it, but you could give it a go. Maybe
    it is a certified banger, maybe it isn't, you'll have to find out.

    Give this bad boy a go. I know I'm too lazy to.

    <h3>
      Steps
    </h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
      <li>
        Combine pork and ground beef in a large, deep skillet over
        medium-high heat; cook and stir until browned and crumbly,
        5 to 7 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add onion and cook until translucent, about 5 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, 1 tablespoon fresh
        parsley, garlic, basil, salt, oregano, and sugar. Reduce heat
        to medium-low and simmer, stirring occasionally, for 30 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        While the sauce is simmering, bring a large pot of lightly
        salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna noodles in the boiling water,
        stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, 8 to 10
        minutes. Drain and set aside. While noodles are cooking, preheat
        the oven to 375 degree F (190 degrees C).
      </li>
      <li>
        Mix cottage cheese, Parmesan cheese, eggs, remaining tablespoon
        fresh parsley, salt, pepper in a large bowl until combined.
      </li>
      <li>
        Assemble lasagna: Spread a spoon or two of sauce over the bottom
        of a 9x13 inch baking dish just to coat it. Place two layers of
        noodles over the sauce to cover.
      </li>
      <li>
        Layer with half the cheese mixture, half the remaining sauce, and
        half of the mozzarella cheese. Repeat layers once more using the
        remaining noodles, cheese mixture, sauce, and mozzarella. Cover
        the baking dish with aluminum foil.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake in the preheated oven for 30 to 40 minutes. Remove the foil
        and bake until the cheese is golden brown, 5 to 10 more minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Remove from the oven and let stand for 10 minutes before cutting
        and serving.
      </li>
    </ol>
